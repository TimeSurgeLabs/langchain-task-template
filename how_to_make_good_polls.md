* Answers should have a 30 character limit
* Answers should be clear and consise
* Answers containing Emojis are a bonus (if appropriate)
* Answers should have 3-4 answer options
* Answers should be related to the question
* If the question is open ended, have 3 questions and then "Other ðŸ‘‡" or "let me know ðŸ‘‡", etc to let them know they should comment
* Should make a poll about 1ce a month on linkedin, more often done in stories
* Good question types includes brainstorming new x, if they are aware of x, can test taglines/images before publishing them, audiences biggest pain points
* Polls around biggest trends/challenges in the current industry, e.g. if you are an ai trainer a poll like Q: Which AI chatbot do you use most often? A1: ChatGPT A2: Bard A3: Bing A4: Claude
* Should respond to comments being helpful since they just did something for you (They answered your poll), this leads to quality conversations
